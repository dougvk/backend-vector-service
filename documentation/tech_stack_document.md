# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

This project is a backend service built to search through podcast transcripts using natural language queries. It reads local text files containing podcast transcripts, splits them into manageable chunks (with the default size set at 2000 words, but adjustable as needed), and then produces vector embeddings using OpenAI’s embedding API. These embeddings are stored and indexed via the llamaindex library. When a GET request is made with a user's query, the system performs a similarity search on these embeddings and returns the top 10 most relevant transcript segments along with the associated podcast title. The choice of technologies focuses on simplicity, efficiency, and easy deployment on a DigitalOcean droplet while maintaining the capability to scale as more episodes are added.

## Frontend Technologies

Since this solution is designed as a backend service without a dedicated user interface, there is no traditional frontend framework or library in use. Instead, the system handles GET requests and returns plain data responses. This design ensures that the service remains lightweight and easy to deploy. Any testing or presentation of the output would typically be done via tools that simulate HTTP requests, keeping the focus on robust backend processing rather than elaborate frontend presentations.

## Backend Technologies

The backend is primarily implemented using Python, chosen for its readability and its powerful ecosystem in data processing and machine learning related tasks. The core functionality is built around the llamaindex library, which manages the creation, storage, and indexing of vector embeddings. For generating these embeddings, the system relies on OpenAI’s embedding API, which transforms chunks of transcript text into vector representations. Python also provides the necessary file I/O operations and logging capabilities to efficiently import local .txt files, extract metadata (such as podcast titles) from file names, split transcripts into chunks, and handle all necessary backend tasks. This approach allows for seamless execution of the primary operations without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Deployment is handled on an affordable DigitalOcean droplet, chosen for its balance of cost and reliability for personal use. The decision to use a DigitalOcean VPS ensures that the solution remains within budget The environment on DigitalOcean is to simply respond to GET requests. Additionally, the solution benefits from standard Python deployment workflows, with configuration settings managed via environment variables or simple configuration files. This setup supports easy logging, debugging, and future scalability, should the need arise to handle more data or improve query responsiveness.

## Third-Party Integrations

The main third-party integrations within this project are OpenAI’s embedding API and the llamaindex library. OpenAI’s API is used to generate vector embeddings from text, which is a central component of making the transcript content searchable using natural language queries. The llamaindex library then takes these embeddings and efficiently indexes them in a vector database-like structure so that similarity searches can return the most relevant transcript segments quickly. These integrations are chosen because they provide robust, state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities without the need for developing complex machine learning models in-house, allowing the project to leverage industry-leading solutions and keep the implementation straightforward.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Even though the system is designed for personal use without sophisticated user authentication, standard security practices are in place. Sensitive information such as API keys for OpenAI is managed securely, typically using environment variables. The service is built to handle expected loads on a DigitalOcean droplet, ensuring that both file operations and network requests are optimized for performance. Logging is implemented for all major operations (such as file reading, embedding generation, indexing, and querying) to aid in identifying and resolving any issues. Furthermore, because the embeddings are generated during a non-real-time processing phase (at transcript import), query responses remain fast and efficient. This blended approach of securing sensitive components and optimizing core operations ensures a smooth and reliable performance even as more transcript files are added over time.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

This tech stack was selected to strike a balance between functionality, simplicity, and cost-effectiveness. Python serves as the backbone for processing, while the combination of OpenAI’s embedding API and the llamaindex library delivers powerful vector-based search capabilities over podcast transcripts. The choice to deploy on a DigitalOcean droplet aligns with the priorities of maintaining an affordable and efficient service for personal use. Although this service does not include a dedicated frontend, its streamlined GET endpoint ensures that user queries are handled in an efficient and transparent manner. Each technology, from backend processing to infrastructure deployment, has been carefully chosen to support the overall goal of providing an effective, scalable, and easy-to-manage system for natural language podcast transcript searches.
